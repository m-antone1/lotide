# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library, but less functional.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. There were many mistakes made and many Bothans died to bring you this library.

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @mantone1/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@mantone1/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `head(...)`: When your array has made a fool of you, this will bring you its head.
* `tail(...)`: When you only want to make soup from the tail of the array.
* `middle(...)`: Can't decide? Take from the middle. That way you never have what you really want.
